# Introduction
You’re working as a medical researcher at the NIH. Using the dataset provided, which biomarker a most likely driver of diabetes (e.g. causes the greatest increase in diabetes risk) – insulin, glucose, or both equally?
Note: For “outcome”, 1=diabetes, 0= no diabetes
Goal: Determine which biomarker is a more likely driver of diabetes - insulin, glucose, or both?

The dataset is the about diabetes and according to Kaggle is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes.

# Implementation
 In this repository, we use the R programming language to briefly explore the features of the data. More specifically, we examined the relationship of insulin and glucose seprately and the imapact they have on diabetes as well as how these two biomarkers together effect the risk of diabetes. We do so using ggplots boxplots, density plots, scatter plots, and line plots.

# Results
 After running our code, we found that glucose is the primary biomarker. Insulin becomes more of a prevelant factor when mixed with glucose but glucose on its own is very important to research and monitor with the risk of diabetes:
